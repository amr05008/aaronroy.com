I recently had the chance to chat with [Loyalty360](https://loyalty360.org/content-gallery/multimedia/loyalty360-thought-leadership-series-aaron-roy,-wa) on how brands are adapting their outreach initiatives during Covid, and how marketers are recalibrating playbooks to be successful in Q3 and Q4. My full chat with the Loyalty 360 team is below. 

It's quite strange to make predictions right now about how businesses will reopen back up for business. Still, I think it's a fair assumption to assume customer loyalty will be a critical component of success for the brands that do succeed in the new normal.
