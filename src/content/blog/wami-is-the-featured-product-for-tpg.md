![Aaron Roy - Product Manager](/images/wami-is-the-featured-product-for-tpg-1759632215298.jpeg) It was an absolute blast serving as the [featured product of the month](https://www.meetup.com/TheProductGroup/events/262224867/) for the Product Group here in New York. We had the chance to talk through our lessons learned while bootstrapping [Wami](https://wami.io), and how vital failure (and learning) is as part of the product cycle. This 20,000 members strong group is an incredible resource of knowledge, expertise, and support for current and aspiring product managers in the NYC area. I highly recommend attending one of their [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/TheProductGroup).
