One of the biggest challenges we faced in the early days of [3DPrinterOS](https://3dprinteros.com) was turning new user signups into active users. We noticed pretty early into our launch that users would signup for our free account tier and then go dark before adding their first 3d printer or some other high-value action in the system. 

I made the walkthrough video below as part of the 3DPrinterOS onboarding experience, to be sent in-app and email via [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), to help new users understand the different features and set up their first 3d printer for use with the operating system.
