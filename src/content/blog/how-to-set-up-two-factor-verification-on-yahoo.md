While researching [ways to improve security and privacy](https://aaronroy.com/how-to-stay-ahead-of-online-scammers/) online, I noticed I couldn't easily find a how-to with examples for setting up two-factor verification for Yahoo email.

Follow the steps below to set up two-factor verification with your Yahoo email account.

Step 1: Click on _"Overview,"_ which is under the _"Account"_ menu

Step 4: Select what method you would like to use as additional verification (the next few steps demonstrate setting up a second verification method via phone number)

Step 7: If you use a phone number for 2FA, you'll need to set up a recovery option as well, start by clicking _"Add recovery option"_

Step 8: Select _"email"_ to add a secondary email account to use for account recovery (in case you are locked out of Yahoo email)

Step 10: Enter the code you received in your recovery email in Yahoo (example below is an email from Yahoo with my verification code)

Step 11: Now that I've added both a phone number as a second method of verification and a secondary email address for account recovery, I'm done (and can click _"Done"_).

Once you have two factor verification set up in Yahoo, you can manage your preferences and verification methods from the ["Security" page](https://login.yahoo.com/myaccount/security).
