It was a pleasure chatting with the [Retail Focus podcast](http://www.retailfocuspodcast.com/podcasts/2018/7/14/retail-focus-71318-walmart-tests-c-store-waters-connecting-with-customers-in-a-new-old-way) on how brands are turning to old-fashioned methods such as handwritten notes to stand out from the typical email bombardment customers see today.
