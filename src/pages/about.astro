      <p>
        I've spent the last decade scaling SaaS companies from early stage to $50M+ ARR, usually through some combination of PLG, pricing experiments, and more recently, AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm Product Director at <a href="https://manychat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manychat</a>, the leading chat marketing platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I was Head of Product at <a href="https://teachable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teachable</a>, where I led Product, Growth, and Support across a platform that's powered $2B+ in creator sales. I also led product at Bond through its acquisition by Newell Brands and joined the founding team at <a href="https://www.3dprinteros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3DPrinterOS</a>, the first cloud operating system for 3D printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side, I'm CEO of Wami, a robotics company I co-founded that produces handwritten notes at scale. We <a href="https://aaronroy.com/the-twisting-tale-of-our-handwriting-robots">acquired the IP and robots</a> from a public company and now serve brands like Gucci, Cartier, and Prada. Before all of this, I started pedicab companies in <a href="https://www.needaridenola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Orleans</a> and Miami. I've been building weird things for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a JD from UConn Law and a BA in Journalism and Political Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not building products, you'll find me riding bikes, diving into cybersecurity rabbit holes, or hanging with my family. I use this site to share what I'm working on and whatever else I find interesting.
